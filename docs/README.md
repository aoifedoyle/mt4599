### The applets below were developed by Aoife Doyle for the MT4599 Project in Mathematics/Statistics at the University of St Andrews. 
##### The applets were designed with the MT1007 Statistics in Pratice module in mind. 
##### The [click here] button should take the user to each individual applet, however, if this is not working in the docs folder with the MT4599 directory the associated Javascript and HTML files can be found. These can be downloaded and run through a R workspace.
